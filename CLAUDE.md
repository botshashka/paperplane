## What This Is

PaperPlane (`ppl`) is a CLI dev tool for Minecraft Paper plugin development. It automates the build-run-test cycle: watches source files, rebuilds via Gradle, manages Paper server instances, and hot-deploys plugins — all with a single `ppl dev` command.

## Build & Test

```bash
# Build the CLI fat jar (includes companion + velocity plugins as embedded resources)
./gradlew :cli:shadowJar

# Run the CLI locally
./ppl dev            # start dev server with file watching
./ppl create         # scaffold a new Paper plugin project (alias: ppl new)
./ppl init           # add PaperPlane to an existing project (alias: ppl setup)
./ppl test           # run tests via Gradle Tooling API
./ppl clean          # clean .paperplane directory

# Run tests
./gradlew test                        # all tests
./gradlew :cli:test                   # CLI tests only
./gradlew :cli:test --tests "dev.paperplane.cli.server.PaperServerManagerTest"  # single test class

# Build individual modules
./gradlew :companion-plugin:shadowJar
./gradlew :velocity-plugin:shadowJar
./gradlew :gradle-plugin:jar
```

## Architecture

Five Gradle submodules (`settings.gradle.kts`):

- **`cli`** — The `ppl` command. Kotlin + Clikt CLI framework. Embeds companion and velocity plugin jars as resources (copied as `.bin` files during build to prevent Shadow from unpacking them). Uses Gradle Tooling API (`GradleBridge`) to invoke builds in the user's project without shelling out.

- **`gradle-plugin`** — Applied to user projects (`dev.paperplane`). Auto-generates `plugin.yml` from a `paperplane {}` extension block, detects Paper API version from dependencies, and produces `metadata.json` (`ppMetadata` task) consumed by the CLI.

- **`companion-plugin`** — Bukkit plugin injected into the dev server at runtime. Provides: build status bar (action bar overlay), error catching/display, auto-op for joining players, save protection during rebuilds, hot-reload orchestration (unload/load plugin JARs), and server-ready signaling via flag files.

- **`velocity-plugin`** — Velocity proxy plugin for blue/green mode. Polls `active-server.json` to route/transfer players between blue and green Paper backends during zero-downtime rebuilds.

- **`agent`** — Minimal Java agent for hot-swap class redefinition. Produces a JAR with `Premain-Class` manifest for `Can-Redefine-Classes` / `Can-Retransform-Classes`.

### Dev Server Modes

Configured via `dev.mode` in `paperplane.yml`:

1. **Restart** (`mode: restart`) — Stops server, rebuilds, restarts. Simple but has downtime.
2. **Blue-green** (`mode: blue-green`) — Two Paper servers behind a Velocity proxy. Rebuilds deploy to the standby server, then players are transferred. Pre-warms the standby after each swap.
3. **Hot-reload** (`mode: hot-reload`) — Single server stays running. Companion plugin unloads/reloads the plugin JAR in-place. Fastest iteration but experimental.

### CLI ↔ Server Communication

The CLI and companion plugin coordinate through flag files in `.paperplane/` inside the server directory:
- `server-ready` — companion writes after `ServerLoadEvent`
- `companion-status.json` — CLI writes build state, companion reads for action bar
- `save-complete` — companion writes after world save
- `reload-complete` / `reload-failed` — companion writes after hot-reload attempt

### TerminalUI Block System

All CLI output goes through `TerminalUI` (`cli/.../ui/TerminalUI.kt`). Spacing between sections is handled by **scoped blocks**, not manual `blank()` or `println()` calls.

**Two scoped primitives:**
- `TerminalUI.block { … }` — one-shot PERSIST block for command output. The lambda receiver is `TerminalUI`, so emit calls (`success(...)`, `info(...)`, `error(...)`) are unqualified. The block closes in a finally, so exceptions can't leak a pinned footer.
- `TerminalUI.phase { … PhaseEnd.Watching }` — iteration-scoped block for dev-server loops. Discards any prior pinned footer, opens a PERSIST block, runs the body, then opens a trailing TRANSIENT footer based on the returned `PhaseEnd`:
  - `PhaseEnd.Watching` → "Watching for changes..."
  - `PhaseEnd.Waiting` → "Waiting for changes..." (build/server failure)
  - `PhaseEnd.None` → no trailing footer (terminal exit)

**Rules:**
- Every block automatically gets 1 blank line above it. To add space between two groups of output, use two `block { }` calls — don't insert `blank()` between them.
- `blank()` is only for intra-block spacing (visual grouping within a single block).
- `serverLog()` interleaves log lines above the pinned footer; safe to call from inside or outside a block/phase.
- `spin(msg) { … }` pins a spinner. Inside a `block { }` / `phase { }` it reuses the outer block; outside, it auto-opens one.
- `TerminalUI.clearPinnedFooter()` clears any pinned footer. Only needed in shutdown hooks as a safety net.
- Deep helpers (`GradleBridge`, `PaperServerManager`, etc.) call typed emit methods (`status`, `error`, `buildError`, `serverLog`) directly — they inherit the current block from whatever phase the command opened.
- `beginBlock` / `endBlock` / `discardBlock` are `@PublishedApi internal` implementation details of `block { }` and `phase { }`. Don't call them directly.

## Commit Convention

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). Format: `<type>: <description>`

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`, `ci`, `build`

## Key Conventions

- Kotlin throughout, Java 21 toolchain, JUnit 6 for tests
- Config is `paperplane.yml` (parsed with kaml/kotlinx-serialization) — see `PaperPlaneConfig.kt` for schema
- The `ppl` launcher script at repo root runs the built CLI jar directly
- Version catalog in `gradle/libs.versions.toml` — all dependency versions managed there
